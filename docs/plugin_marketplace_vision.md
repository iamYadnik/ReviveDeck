# 🌐 ReviveDeck Plugin Marketplace Vision

This document outlines a long-term vision for creating a community-driven plugin ecosystem for ReviveDeck.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

To allow developers to extend ReviveDeck through reusable modules (plugins), enhancing core functionality and encouraging innovation from the open-source community.

---

## 🧩 What Are Plugins?

Plugins are optional Python modules placed in the `/plugins` folder.

Each plugin:
- Defines a `register()` function
- May include optional CLI/GUIs/tools
- May interact with core ReviveDeck APIs (launcher, stats, themes, etc.)

---

## 📦 Marketplace Features (Planned)

- Web-based plugin directory with descriptions and install buttons
- Plugin metadata schema (`plugin.json`) for name, version, author, requirements
- UI integration: plugin browser in GUI dashboard
- Validation tool to check syntax, metadata, and registration
- GitHub or local file-based plugin install options
- Auto-update mechanism (opt-in)

---

## 🔐 Security Guidelines

- Plugins must run in a sandboxed, documented environment
- No arbitrary file access or external network calls without consent
- Plugins must be open-source and GPL/MIT compatible

---

## 📢 Example Plugin Ideas

- FPS & telemetry overlays
- Gamepad mapping profiles
- Cloud sync for saved config
- Screenshot logger or replay recorder
- Local leaderboard or challenge manager

---

## 🤝 Community Guidelines

- Plugin authors must follow contribution and licensing standards
- Moderated plugin registry to avoid malicious code
- Optional badges: Verified, Popular, Staff Pick

---

## 🛠 Milestones

- [ ] Finalize plugin.json spec
- [ ] Build plugin validator (✅ complete)
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions for plugin test coverage
- [ ] Build GUI plugin browser
- [ ] Launch first public plugin registry

Let’s grow ReviveDeck beyond a launcher — into a platform.
